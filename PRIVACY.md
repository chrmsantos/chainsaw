# Privacy Notice

## Scope

This notice explains how the Chainsaw automation tooling treats data while running macros, PowerShell utilities, and related scripts that accompany the project.

## Data Handling Principles

- Process only the documents selected by the user; never crawl arbitrary directories.
- Avoid persisting copies of processed files beyond the configured backup location.
- Prefer in-memory operations when transforming document content.
- Keep logs concise and redact personally identifiable information when the message is not essential for troubleshooting.

## Information Collected

Chainsaw may temporarily handle the following data:

- Document text and formatting metadata required for macros to operate.
- Configuration values stored under `config/`, including logging preferences and backup paths.
- Diagnostic messages written to `logs/` for troubleshooting purposes.

No analytics, telemetry, or external network transmission is performed by default.

## Storage and Retention

- Backups generated by macros are kept in `backups/` until the user archives or deletes them.
- Log files can contain contextual snippets; review and purge them periodically.
- Configuration files remain on the local machine and should be protected with standard OS permissions.

## Third-Party Services

Chainsaw does not send data to third parties. When Microsoft Word or PowerShell modules are used, they operate under the user's local licensing terms and may inherit their own privacy practices.

## User Controls

- Configure logging verbosity to minimize exposure of sensitive details.
- Disable automatic backups if organizational policy forbids duplicate document copies.
- Run the tooling inside isolated user profiles when working with confidential material.
